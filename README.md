### Hello, there

My name is Diego Camacho, I'm a passionate MSc in bioinformatics and data analyst with expertise in analyzing and interpreting NGS multi-omic datasets, including RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, Methyl-seq, ChIp-seq and Hi-C data. My professional journey spans institutions like the Université de Montréal, CHU Sainte-Justine, UCLA and the EPFL, where I contributed to projects involving high-throughput data quality control, differential analysis, and pathway enrichment using tools like R and Python. With strong programming skills in R, Python, linux and SQL, alongside proficiency in data visualization and machine learning, I excel in delivering insights from complex biological data.  My GitHub showcases projects that reflect my commitment to advancing computational genomics through innovative solutions and collaborative bioinformatic tool development. Such is organized by projects and analysis to make it easier to store, revisit and update.
